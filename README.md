# Graduation_Prject

Graduation Project
This repository contains the source code and related materials for a graduation project focused on medical image analysis using deep learning techniques.​

Project Overview
The project encompasses two primary applications:​

Pneumonia Diagnosis: A deep learning model designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.​

Brain Tumor Detection: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model aimed at identifying brain tumors in MRI scans.​

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories and files:​

Docke/: Contains Docker-related configurations for setting up the project environment.​

gp/: Houses the main application code for the project.​

decomintation/: Includes documentation related to the project's development and implementation.​

presntation/: Contains presentation materials summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and results.​

webSite/: Comprises the frontend code for the project's web interface.​

Pneumonia Diagnosis.rar: Archive file containing resources and code specific to the pneumonia diagnosis application.​
GitHub

brain_tumer_detection.rar: Archive file containing resources and code specific to the brain tumor detection application.​
